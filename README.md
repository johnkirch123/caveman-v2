# Crypto Cavemen V2

This web app will be the current homebase for all future Crypto Cavemen interactions.

See [Cavemen DApp](https://crypto-cavemen-v2.herokuapp.com/) for live demo.

## Getting Started

The dapp is a client side only project and is built using the [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) scripts. A backend will be built for Shells staking rewards and Smart Contracts will be integrated for distributions, minting, and the future market place. The backend will help create structure as the project grows utilizing Express and MongoDB in an NodeJS environment. This project is focusing on building before seeking investor capital to build investor confidence, the opposite of what is mainly happening in the Elrond NFT space.

## Dashboard

The Dashboard will show all of your interactions with the project. You will need to login via wallet connect and this will showcase your NFT's that you own in every collection and the amount of Shells that you have collected so far. If no NFT's are owned there will be links to the Dead Rare, Isengard, and Trust Market exchanges to purchase NFT's from those collections. In the future this Dashboard will change radically. This is where you will stake your NFT's, vote on DAO proposals, engage with the marketplace, and more.

## Roadmap

See the [Roadmap](https://crypto-cavemen-v2.herokuapp.com/roadmap) for a general idea of where the project is heading and what some of the future plans are. A professional writer is currently editing the whitepaper and that will be available as soon as it is complete.

## Collections

See the [Collections](https://crypto-cavemen-v2.herokuapp.com/collections) page where all collections of the project will be showcased.

## About

See the [About](https://crypto-cavemen-v2.herokuapp.com/about) for information about the team members of the project. Currently it is just me until we get to the Gen 2 Cavemen launch phase where I will include the other contributors and their roles will grow signficantly within the project.

## Contributing

I will be looking for additional contributors to the project after I begin smart contract integration. We currently have 2 additional cave peoples that are contributing and their positions will grow with the project over time.
